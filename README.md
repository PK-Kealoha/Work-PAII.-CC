 artist/s: The artist who sang or covered or made the instrumental of the song
 
danceability: How suitable a track is for dancing based on a combination of musical elements including tempo, rhythm stability, beat strength, and overall regularity. A value of 0.0 is least danceable and 1.0 is most danceable.

energy: Perceptual measure of intensity and activity based on its dynamic range, perceived loudness, timbre, onset rate, and general entropy. The values range from 0.0 to 1.0.

loudness: Overall loudness of a track in decibels. Loudness values are averaged across the entire track. Values usually range between -60 and 0 db.

mode: Type of scale from which its melodic content is derived. Major is represented by 1 and minor is 0

speechiness: Detects the presence of spoken words in a track. The more exclusively speech-like the recording, the closer to 1.0 the attribute value. Values above 0.66 describe tracks that are probably made entirely of spoken words. Values between 0.33 and 0.66 describe tracks that may contain both music and speech, either in sections or layered, including such cases as rap music. Values below 0.33 most likely represent music and other non-speech-like tracks.
